Hi! Iâ€™m Ina. A CS student at UBC (BCS program) who stumbled into tech and decided to stay.
I like building small things that work, learning by breaking stuff, and turning curiosity into code.
I also work as a TA, which helps me slowly get better at speaking up in meetings and feeling more confident in my git commits (and in myself).
