summary: How I bought a domain, failed with S3, and ended up with Cloudflare Pages

# Introduction

One day, I felt an urge to set up my blog out of nowhere and decided to put it into motion before the feeling faded. Nothing huge ‚Äî just a place to record what I‚Äôve made, how I‚Äôve struggled, and what I‚Äôve felt during my journey in computer science. A personal touch is a plus.

## Buying a Domain

Luckily, my name is not very common, so I could secure .com, .org, .ca, .dev, et cetera. I chose .dev to focus on sharing my experience as a student developer.

While there are tons of websites that offer various domain options, [Porkbun](Porkbun.com) leans more on a cheaper side with an occasional first-year discount. In my case, it starts from 8 USD for the first year and 12 USD for extension.

Setting up with Porkbun is fast and convenient. Just pick a domain, sign up, and pay with Apple Pay. That's pretty much all.

## Connecting to Cloudflare

I connected to my domain to [Clloudflare](cloudflare.com) to

Since Cloudflare offers the same price for the extension, I'm going to migrate the domain to Cloudflare once the first-year discount is over.

## Trying AWS S3 Hosting

## Migrating to Cloudflare Pages

# Conclusion

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
